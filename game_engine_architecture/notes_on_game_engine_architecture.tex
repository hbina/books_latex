\section{Introduction}

This book serves as a personal note as I read \textit{Game Engine Architecture 3rd Edition} by Jason Gregory.
It will mostly contain keywords and concepts that I did not fully understood.
The goal is to layout what I think of the problem and try to figure it out as I am writing.
The book will obviously contain flaws and misunderstanding so it shouldn't serve as a reference as any kind.
I will not be responsible for any bugs :).


\section{Problems with Ogre 3D Engine}

I could not, for the life of me, compile Ogre from the source in Linux nor Windows.
The author (of the book) mentioned that he will guide us through some parts of its code.
This will definitely come as a problem in the future as I cannot test changes to figure out how things work.

I do have some experience with Godot.
Perhaps I can use that as a reference instead.
We will see how it develops.

\section{The Difference Between Analytical and Numerical Models}

-- Explain how mathematical models are required to allow computation -- since computers don't understand words.
-- Explain how there are two ways to describe a given system mathematically.

\subsection{Analytical Model}

-- The most accurate model but very hard to realize in hardware.

\subsection{Numerical Model}

-- Not the most accurate model but relatively easy to implement in hardware.
-- Will require infinite iteration to come to actual result.
-- But we are interested in pure accuracy.
-- We also care about consistency and practicality, of course.

\section{What is Binary Space Partitioning Trees and Portal-Based Rendering Systems}

-- I have no idea what any of these are.

\section{The Quake II Source Code!}

The source code for the famous Quake II is freely available online!

-- Take a look and explain here?

\section{The Unreal Engine Source Code!}

The source code for Unreal Engine 4 is also freely available online!

-- Take a look and explain them here?

\section{What is the Windows Messaging System}

--- Google what is Windows Messaging system?

\section{Terminologies in 3D Rendering}

\subsection{Geometric Primitives}

Otherwise known as \textit{render packets}.

\subsection{Meshes}

\subsection{Vertex}

\subsection{Line Lists}

\subsection{Point Lists}

\subsection{Particles}

\subsection{Terrain Patches}
