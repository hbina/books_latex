\section{Meta Critics}

\subsection{Why Not Just Use ????}

-- I forgot the actual term, but it is like a matrix filtering.

We are given an input matrix $I$ of size $M \times N$ and a smaller matrix $K$, usually of size $3 \times 3$.
Then, for every value at $(m, n)$ we apply some function $f$ taking the values of $K$ and the surrounding coordinates.

Instead, the author spent a long time explaining all of this with verbose mathematics that are not justified.

\section{Note To Self}

Is there a mathematics library in C++?
