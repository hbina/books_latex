\section{Introduction}

This book will lay out what I am thinking when refactoring Godot to modernize it.
It will also function as a working diary for me.

\section{Updating the build script}

We will be using C++17 for this project.
To enable this, we have to modify the build script used, Scons.
Simply adding the switch should be sufficient.

\section{Constexpr math function}

This should be trivial enough to implement.

TODO :: gcem still does not support constexpr floating point modulo operation

\section{Replacing Macros with Templates}

Macros are ugly and hard to debug.

\section{Using Enum Classes Instead of Basic Enums}

Reduce type misinterpretations.

\section{Use Variadic Templates}

vformat is like printf but it only accepts a number of Variant as parameters.
This function can easily be transformed into a variadic templates that accepts a bunch of Variants.
This will increase compile time due to the fact that multiple copies have to be made.
The upside is that the runtime cost is reduced due to the fact that there are no branching necessary for checking.

\section{Rework Variant}
